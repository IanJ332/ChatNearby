1. amdin classification, root should be the highest level 1 administrator, can delete chat rooms, can ban users, can set administrators. Level 2 ordinary administrators can ban users.
2. Dark mode needs to be added later, first the default browser mode, and then users can adjust it manually
3. There are still problems with the mobile port, see the photos for details
5. Rename should exist, and the renamed name cannot be the same as the person who can speak now.
6. The background should display the IP and ID.
7. There is a ban time (ban IP)
8. There should be a management dashboard, which is implemented through cmd and can be used after npm start. I haven't thought about what features it should have, but I can confirm that the process of banning people or increasing management permissions should be:
List of people in the chat room:
1. [Name] - [IP address]
． ． ．
User input: 1

Select operation:
U: Increase administrator privileges; S: Ban; B: Ban this IP and do not allow it to enter my chat room

Then the corresponding person with increased administrator privileges cannot be banned or banned from speaking
After banning, you can select the ban time in minutes.
The banned IP will be stored in a system file and can be deleted by the user
The storage cell is [Name] - [IP address]: [Banned time]
